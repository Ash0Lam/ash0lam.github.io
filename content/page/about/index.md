# 👋 Hi, I'm Ash!

I enjoy **turning ideas into reality**. AI fascinates me because it **simplifies tasks that were once complex and inaccessible**, making advanced technology more usable for everyone. I believe AI should be open and approachable, not restricted by high barriers or monopolized by corporations.

## **🎯 What Drives Me**
- **AI as a tool for creativity & accessibility** – AI helps me bring my **thoughts and concepts to life**, even when I lack the technical skills to code everything from scratch.
- **Voice Recognition & Speech AI** – Breaking language barriers through AI-driven **speech recognition and communication** is something that excites me.
- **Experimenting & Problem-Solving** – I don't like just memorizing theories; I prefer testing things, finding solutions, and applying **any method necessary** to get results.

## **🛠️ My FYP: AI-Powered Interactive Robot**
My Final Year Project (FYP) focuses on **building an AI-driven robot** that can interact with people through **speech, motion, and vision analysis**.  
- Initially, it was controlled via a **Telegram Bot**, allowing users to send commands remotely.  
- Now, it has evolved into a **real-time WebSocket-based system**, offering **instant interaction and voice communication** between the robot and the PC server.  

This project **made me realize the joy of seeing a machine respond to my commands and ideas**, reinforcing my passion for **human-computer interaction and automation**.

## **🔧 Skills & Tools**
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Utilizing **AI-generated code** to develop applications efficiently.
- **Speech & NLP**: Implementing **Whisper AI, Azure Speech Services, GPT-based chatbot**.
- **Backend & System Integration**: Developing **Flask & WebSocket-based control systems** for real-time interaction.
- **Problem-Solving & Experimentation**: I focus on **practical solutions over theoretical perfection**, adapting new tools and AI-assisted development methods.

## **📌 What’s Next?**
While I’m unsure about my **exact future path**, I hope to **explore more AI applications** and **continue developing automation & interactive systems**. My **ultimate goal is to work in a field that excites me**, where I can **experiment, create, and innovate** without limitations.
