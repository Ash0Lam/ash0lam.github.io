# 👋 Hi, I'm Ash!  
Welcome to **Omakase by Ash**, a space where I share my journey in AI, robotics, and personal creative explorations.  

I primarily work with **AI-assisted development**, using tools like **ChatGPT and Claude to generate and refine code**. My approach focuses on leveraging **AI automation to accelerate software development**, optimizing workflows, and integrating AI with real-world applications.  


## 🔥 Interests  
- **AI & Robotics** 🤖 – Exploring AI-driven automation and real-time interactions  
- **Experimenting with new technologies** 💡 – Trying out AI tools, coding solutions, and workflow optimization  
- **Casual Digital Creations** 🎨 – Video editing, simple graphics, and personal projects (just for fun)  
- **Pastry & Desserts** 🍰 – Former pastry experience, blending precision with creativity  
- **A sushi lover** 🍣 – Especially tuna sashimi!  

## 📌 My Projects  
- **AI-Powered Robotics & Chatbot (FYP)**  
  - Developed a **chatbot-integrated robotic system**, controlled via text & voice  
  - **Live video streaming** via WebSocket for AI-powered vision analysis (Azure Vision)  
  - Built a **web-based control interface** with real-time status updates & movement commands  
  - Technologies: **Flask, WebSocket, OpenCV, Python, NLP**  

- **This Website (Omakase by Ash)**  
  - Developed with **Hugo & Netlify**, serving as a portfolio & personal blog  

- **Open-source AI Integrations** ([GitHub](https://github.com/ash0lam))  
  - Experimenting with **speech-to-text, chatbot response tuning, and image analysis**  

## 🎯 Skills & Experience  
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Leveraging **ChatGPT, Claude, and AI-generated code** for software development & iteration  
- **Backend & API Integration**: Developed **Flask + WebSocket backend** for AI-driven robotics  
- **IT & Hardware Experience**: Involved in **Data Center & Smart Hands services**  
- **Version Control & Collaboration**: Experienced with **GitHub workflows & project management**  

## 🍰 Creativity & Pastry Background  
Although my main focus is technology, my **pastry background** has influenced the way I approach **design, structure, and execution**.  
✔ **Attention to detail** – Precision in both desserts and technical problem-solving  
✔ **Creative mindset** – Balancing structured execution with creative solutions  
✔ **Process optimization** – Streamlining workflows for better efficiency
