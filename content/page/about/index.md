# 👋 Hi, I'm Ash!

I'm passionate about applying **AI and automation** to solve real-world problems. I enjoy building **interactive, user-focused systems** that make technology more intuitive, efficient, and accessible. Whether it's streamlining daily tasks or enabling natural interaction with machines, I aim to create tools that are both **practical and impactful**.

## 🎯 What Drives Me
- **AI as a tool for usability** – I believe AI should simplify, not complicate. I enjoy exploring how AI can be made approachable and useful in daily workflows.
- **Automation for productivity** – I like building tools that eliminate repetitive tasks and enhance efficiency — especially in environments where resources are limited.
- **Interaction & experience** – I’m fascinated by how people engage with technology, whether through voice, vision, or responsive systems.

## 🛠️ Projects from School

### **AI-Powered Interactive Robot (FYP)**
My Final Year Project focused on creating a robot capable of **speech-based interaction, computer vision, and real-time control**.
- Evolved from a **Telegram bot control system** to a **WebSocket-based voice interface**.
- Used **Whisper, Azure Speech**, and **GPT chatbot logic** to support multilingual and real-time communication.
- Reinforced my passion for combining AI with responsive, interactive systems.

### **Python-Based Forum System**
As part of a web application development course, I built a **full-stack forum system** using Python and SQLite.
- Included user authentication, post/thread management, and simple admin controls.
- Helped strengthen my backend fundamentals and database handling skills.

## 💡 Independent Project from Work

### **Outlook Template Bartender**
While working in a corporate environment, I noticed how many colleagues struggled with slow Outlook performance when reusing email templates — especially on older machines. That sparked the idea for this tool.

**Outlook Template Bartender** is a lightweight, offline desktop app that helps users quickly manage and send templated Outlook emails with dynamic variables.  
- Built with **Python + Tkinter**, with **HTML editing via pywebview and CKEditor**.  
- Integrated **Outlook COM automation**, variable placeholders, and account selection.  
- Designed for **low-resource environments**, respecting user privacy and minimizing system load.

This project reflects my mindset: **see a problem → build a solution**.

## 🔧 Skills & Tools

**AI & NLP**: Whisper, Azure Speech, GPT chatbots  
**Backend**: Python, Flask, SQLite, WebSockets  
**Frontend/UI**: Tkinter, pywebview, CKEditor  
**Automation**: Outlook COM scripting, task optimization tools  
**Approach**: AI-assisted development, rapid prototyping, real-world problem solving

## 🚀 What’s Next?
I’m currently exploring more ways to apply AI in automation, developer tools, and interactive systems.  
My goal is to work in a space where I can **create, experiment, and grow**, building solutions that make a difference in how people interact with technology.
