# ü§ñ Evolution of AI-Powered Voice Interaction Robot  
**From Telegram-based control to real-time WebSocket communication.**  

## **üìå Project Overview**  
This **Final Year Project (FYP)** focuses on developing an **AI-powered robotic assistant** that enhances **human interaction through voice communication, real-time video processing, and physical actions**.  

Between **November 2024 and March 2025**, the system underwent a significant evolution. Initially, the robot was controlled via a **Telegram bot**, allowing users to send commands remotely through a chat interface. However, in its latest iteration, the system now uses **WebSocket communication**, enabling real-time interactions between the **PC-based Python server and the robot's Python client**.

This transition has **greatly improved** response time, system stability, and expanded the range of **possible interactions**.

## **üõ†Ô∏è System Evolution: November 2024 vs. March 2025**
| **Feature** | **November 2024 (Telegram Bot Control)** | **March 2025 (WebSocket Real-Time Communication)** |
|------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Control Method** | Users controlled the robot via **Telegram chat commands** | Users interact via **Flask-based web interface or speech** |
| **Speech Processing** | Whisper AI for STT, Azure Speech Services for TTS | Whisper AI for STT, Azure Speech Services for TTS |
| **AI Chatbot** | GPT-3.5 via OpenAI API for simple conversations | **LangChain-based chatbot** with **better context retention** |
| **Video Streaming** | Not available | **Real-time WebSocket video transmission from robot to PC** |
| **Motion Control** | Simple Telegram commands for pre-set movements | WebSocket-controlled **adaptive gesture interaction** |
| **Cloud Dependency** | Heavy reliance on Telegram servers & OpenAI API | Shift towards **local processing for improved privacy** |

## **üîπ Technical Implementation**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Phase 1: Telegram Bot-Based Control (November 2024)**
- Users could **send commands** via **Telegram**, and the robot would respond.
- **Predefined movement commands** (e.g., `/wave`, `/move_forward`).
- AI chatbot responses powered by **GPT-3.5 via OpenAI API**.
- **Limitations:** limited interaction capabilities, **no real-time vision processing**.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Phase 2: WebSocket-Based Real-Time Control (March 2025)**
- Implemented **PC-based Flask server** for **direct interaction with the robot**.
- **WebSocket replaced Telegram API**, allowing **instant, bidirectional communication**.
- Users can now:
  - **Send text or voice commands** via a Flask-based web UI.
  - **Receive real-time responses** from the AI chatbot.
  - **Control the robot‚Äôs movements dynamically**.
  - **Stream live video from the robot‚Äôs camera** for vision-based interactions.
- **Improvements:** **better motion control**, **real-time vision processing**.
