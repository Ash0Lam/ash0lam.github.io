## **Introduction**

While working in corporate environments, I observed a recurring issue â€“ many employees use outdated office computers, yet have to handle tons of Outlook emails daily. Opening Outlook templates often slows down the entire machine. Even when templates load, tasks like selecting recipients, manually editing placeholders, or reusing email formats become tedious and error-prone.

That's when I thought: **why not create a lightweight, local desktop application, to help manage and automate repetitive Outlook email templates without bogging down the system?**

Thus, **Outlook Template Bartender** was born â€“ designed as a privacy-respecting, fully offline assistant that "serves up" pre-made, dynamically customizable Outlook emails quickly and reliably, even on low-spec machines.

---

## **Objectives**
The project was designed to solve:

1. **Outlook lagging issues** when handling repetitive templates or bulk emails.
2. **Simplifying repetitive email tasks** via one-click template management.
3. **Variable replacement support**, allowing users to insert placeholders like `{receiver}`, `{date}`, etc.
4. **Support for older office PCs** â€“ lightweight, no cloud dependency.
5. **Direct integration with Outlook**, eliminating the need to manually find, edit, or copy templates.

## **What's New in Version 1.2**

### ðŸ”¹ **Smart @Mentions Feature**
- Use `@{Email}` syntax in your templates to automatically convert email addresses to proper @mentions.
- For example, `@{manager}` will be converted to `@John Doe` when `manager` variable is filled with `john.doe@company.com`.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Backend & UI**: Python (Tkinter)
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Email Integration**: win32com for Outlook
- **HTML Editing**: CKEditor embedded via pywebview
- **Supporting Libraries**: psutil, pywebview, pywin32, pillow, re (for regex patterns)
- **Development Approach**: Human-AI collaboration with Claude & GPT-4 AI assistants generating code based on my ideas and requirements

This project represents a modern development approach where I focused on the concept, requirements gathering, and testing, while leveraging AI assistants to help with code generation. This allowed rapid development while ensuring the tool precisely addressed the real-world needs I identified.

---

## **Conclusion**
With version 1.2, **Outlook Template Bartender** has become even more powerful while maintaining its lightweight footprint. The new Smart @Mentions feature enhances email interactivity, while improved HTML handling ensures perfectly preserved formatting.
