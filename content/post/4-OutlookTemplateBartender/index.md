## **Introduction**

While working in corporate environments, I observed a recurring issue â€“ many employees use outdated office computers, yet have to handle tons of Outlook emails daily. Opening Outlook templates often slows down the entire machine. Even when templates load, tasks like selecting recipients, manually editing placeholders, or reusing email formats become tedious and error-prone.

Thatâ€™s when I thought: **why not create a lightweight, local desktop application, to help manage and automate repetitive Outlook email templates without bogging down the system?**

Thus, **Outlook Template Bartender** was born â€“ designed as a privacy-respecting, fully offline assistant that "serves up" pre-made, dynamically customizable Outlook emails quickly and reliably, even on low-spec machines.

## **Objectives**
The project was designed to solve:

1. **Outlook lagging issues** when handling repetitive templates or bulk emails.
2. **Simplifying repetitive email tasks** via one-click template management.
3. **Variable replacement support**, allowing users to insert placeholders like `{receiver}`, `{date}`, etc.
4. **Support for older office PCs** â€“ lightweight, no cloud dependency.
5. **Direct integration with Outlook**, eliminating the need to manually find, edit, or copy templates.
